Origin: https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk
Change: 95ea6acad131124694cda1c162c52cd30e0aece0
Tag: 2.1.0

This is the contents of src/boards, src/common,
src/rp2040, src/rp2350, and src/rp2_common.

I suspect we'll trim it back closer to just the
register definitions, but for now leave it mostly
as-is to simplify updating as the pico sdk updates
and we figure out how deeply (or not) to integrate
it with lk.
